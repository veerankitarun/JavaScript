// what is JavaScipt ?
 JavaScript is a High-level( we dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory management ), Object-oriented ( based on objects, for storting most kings of data ), Multi-paradigm programming language( instruct computer to do things )
 
 
 // The role of JavaScript in web Development
 
 html( content ), css(presentation), js(programming language: Building web application )
 
 
 // Front-end apps 
  Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
    react, angular, vue
    
  // Back-end apps
     web application on web servers
     node.js
    
 // Native mobile apps
   react, ionic
   
 // Native desktop apps
    atom
    
    

// Problem: Values and Variables
          1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
             assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
          2. Log their values to the console

soulutionForGivenQuestion:
    let country = 'Portugal'; // declearing the variable 
    let continent = 'Europe';
    let population = 10;
    console.log(country); // to display on console
    console.log(continent);
    console.log(population);


// Data Types
                 VALUE 
          OBJECT   or   PRIMITIVE
         let me={               let firstName = 'jonas;

1. number: Floating point numbers(Used for decimal and integers)
2. String: Sequence of character(Used for text)
3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false(Used for taking decision)
4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined('empty value')
5. Null:  also means 'empty value'


//                                 problem:

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

//       Code
             const massMark = 78;
            const heightMark = 1.88;
            const massJohn = 85;
            const heightJohn = 1.76;

           const BmiMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
           const BmiJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
           const markHeightBmi = BmiMark > BmiJohn;

console.log(BmiMark, BmiJohn, markHeightBmi);
